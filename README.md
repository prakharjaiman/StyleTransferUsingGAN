# StyleTransferUsingGAN

The Dashtoon.ipynb file contains the final code for the style transfer model. In order to run the code, run it in the order given in Dashtoon.ipynb. 
The file contains example of images and final images. The quality of images can be improved provided with better GPU resources. 

The dataset contained photos by monet and landscape photos via a publically available dataset. 

No. of epochs = 30 (which can be changed in code to any number)

**NOTE: The dimensions of images are kept to 256*256 and epochs are set to 30 due to limited GPU resources. As one epoch was taking around 10 mins to complete.
